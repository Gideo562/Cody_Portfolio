# Cody's Portfolio
Past Data Science, Machine Learning, and Neural Signal Processing Projects

# [Project 1: Blockbuster Revenue Predictions](https://github.com/Gideo562/BlockBusterRevenue.git) 
Created a revenue prediction model that looked for similarities among all high grossing films to
find out what factors help contribute to these movie successes by utilizing apis and libraries such as:
* pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib

# Project 2: Wal-Mart Unemployment Predictor
Created a model that predicted factors that help solve what is one of the main leading
contributions towards unemployment for walmart employees using libraries and apis such as:
* pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib

# Project 3: Monkey Neural Signal Processing
Took an existing csv file that had information on neural activity of a monkeyâ€™s brain under different conditions such as 
(sleep, comatose, and awake) and plotted them to see the difference in activity among each condition 
using libraries and apis such as: 
* scipy, pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib 

# (Current In-Progress) Project 4: Pokemon Battle Predictor
Taking existing data from kaggle, the goal of the project is to develop a model that will predict a winner between 
two pokemon based on different stats that they carry.
